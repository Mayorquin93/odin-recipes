    <p>The iconic pizza margherita is also known for representing the colours of the Italian flag: red tomato sauce, white mozzarella, and green basil. The combination of these ingredients creates a delicious pizza which has withstood the test of time.

    <h2>How to make Traditional Italian Pizza step by step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle the yeast into a medium bowl with the warm water. We don’t mean hot, and we don’t mean cold… we mean warm! That’s the kind the yeast likes best. Stir until the yeast dissolves.</li>
            <li>Place almost all of the flour on the table in the shape of a volcano. (Think Mt. Vesuvius… appropriate since Naples is the king of all pizza cities!).</li>
            <li>our the yeast-and-warm-water mix, along with the other ingredients, into the “crater” of the volcano</li>
            <li>Knead everything together for 10 to 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic, keeping your surface floured</li>
            <li>Grease up a bowl with some olive oil and put the dough inside. Turn the dough around so the top is slightly oiled</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and put the dough aside to let it rest for at least four or five hours</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to about 400°F, or about 200°C.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half and let it rest for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Roll each section into a 12-inch disc. Now is your chance to decide how thick you want your pizza to be! Do you want it pizza alta (Neapolitan-style) or pizza bassa (Roman-style)? Just remember, your crust will puff up a little bit as it is baked!</li>
            <li>ransfer the dough onto an oiled pizza pan or baking sheet</li>
            <li>Add tomato sauce, if you want a pizza rossa (red pizza). Lots of pizzas in Italy are actually pizza bianca, without tomato sauce, so don’t feel like you have to! Brush the edges of the crust with a little bit of olive oil</li>
            <li>Bake each pizza for about 10 minutes, then add mozzarella cheese (sliced or grated) on top, as well as any other ingredients</li>
            <li>Let the pizzas bake until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted. By lifting up the pizza to peek underneath, you can make sure the bottom has browned, too</li>
            <li>Remove your pizzas from the oven and, for a real Italian touch, garnish with a few basil leaves. And enjoy!</li>
