    <h2>How to make Bolognese pasta step by step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan until shimmering. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the saucepan and heat until just shimmering. Add the beef, veal, and pork and cook over moderately high heat until just barely pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return the vegetable mixture to the saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute</li>
            <li>Add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost evaporated, about 8 minutes</li>
            <li>Cover partially and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour. Discard the bay leaf. Stir in the heavy cream and cook the sauce just until heated through</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente</li>
            <li>Drain well, return to the pot, add the sauce, and toss</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta in deep bowls and pass the Parmesan at the table</li>
        </ol>
